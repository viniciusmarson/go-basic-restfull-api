# RESTful API

This repository is only for educational purposes. You will find a basic implementation of a RESTful API in the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/) using [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)

If you are going to create a RESTful API, you would need somewhere to store and retrieve data. However, that is beyond the scope of this repository, so I simply created a very crude (and not thread safe) mock database.


### Building

Requires [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed.

To build a new executable just run the command go build.

Example:

```sh
$ go build
```
